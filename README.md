# Gender Gap Analyser
A program written in Java for my bachelor's degree thesis that downloads a dataset of men's and women's salaries from the United States, from the U.S. Departmant of Labor's website, and that analyses the salaries, creates graphs and predictions. It uses JavaFX in order to have a GUI.
